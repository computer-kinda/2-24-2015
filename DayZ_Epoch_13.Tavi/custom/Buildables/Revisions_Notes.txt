	v 1.1  Added catch for possible duping with punishment of radius deletion
			Also added lightbulbs to craftables
			74 items total with this version
	v 1.2 Removed catch and punishment and re-wrote code to delete items from
			player's backpack as soon as pre-reqs are met then to add them back
			in if the player cancels crafting
	v 1.3  Cleaned up code and simplified a few routines. 
			MAJOR CHANGE
	v 2.0  Ported old right click crafting system to new menu based system
			as a variation of concept found in Raymix's Emerald Interior Designer
			http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/10665-release-emerald-interior-designer/
	v 2.05 Moved much duplicated code to two new functions in Crafting_Compiles.sqf
			to simplify code and possibly speed things up a little.
	v 2.1  Added all items from Emerald Interiors to item set.
	v 2.2  Created new system with material/tool definitions using classes
			in MT_Defines.hpp. Allows for cross file data usage by pulling
			from missionconfigfile.	Added required tools and materials to all items.
	v 2.3 Changed menu gui to show items and materials that player currently
			has in inventory to display as green and those the player does not have
			to display as red. Makes for easier item selection across Catagories
	v 2.4  Added back in several items from before 1.0 - Top heavy items like
	       the satellite dish must be set inside ground or they will fall over when placed
	       267 items total with this version
	v 2.5  Added many other MAP, (map_eu), and LAND,(base Arma2), items that were useable in editor 
			Passed on many duplicate items between MAP and LAND as well as most
			buildings that were not fortifications or tents.
			565 total items with this version
	v 2.6  Edited/updated files for compatibility with 112555/1.0.5.1
			This included several changes to allow client usage on servers using Infistar
	v 2.65 Removed ladders and most towers due to non-functionality of ladder
	v 2.7  Added custom dayz_spaceInterrupt function to allow usage of number keys
			1 and 3, (above qwerty), to allow rotation of item in 22.5 degree increments
			MAJOR CHANGE
	v 3.0  Added in preview functionality to craft menu using my old uav script as base- Thanks to [GOM] Simbo for the idea!
			Item being previewed is circled by camera. Changed code so that the
			Since Infistar was blocking setbuttonaction commands, three new buttons were
			added and simply turned off with others at start.
	v 3.1  Added in camera control buttons to Preview screen. <<Spin Spin>> moves camera
			around item faster or slower. Zoom- Zoom+ move camera closer/further away
			from item. Camera Up Camera Down changed view altitude.
	v 3.2  Added global variable to use with dayz_spaceInterrupt function in order
			to capture any keyboard input at all during Preview. This helped stop
			a bug where ESC would remove the Return button forcing player to relog.
			Once inside the Preview pressing any key will have same functionality as
			using the mouse to press the Return button.
			Added Admin_Craft variable to variables.sqf and in checks for tools/materials in 
			custom_builds.sqf to allow easier testing/crafting.

	v 3.21 Fixed issue with many items not showing materials or tools in the crafting
			window while using Admin_Craft.
	v 3.3  Restructured classes to have master Default classes for most menu Catagory selections. 
			This cleaned up a few 1,000 lines of uneeded code and allows editing/updating of 
			tools and materials easier for most classes. Added in DefaultGem class for
			several simple/small items. These require a toolbox, the gem for that class and two
			10Oz Gold bars. Consolidated many similar items to have same materials/tools.
